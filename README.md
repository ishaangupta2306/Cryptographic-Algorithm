## What is MD5 checksum?
An MD5 (also known as message-digest method 5) checksum is a 32-character hexadecimal number that is computed on a file. If two files have the same MD5 checksum value, then there is a high probability that the two files are the same.

## What is the MD5 checksum algorithm?
Based on the concept of MD5 discussed above, the MD5 checksum algorithm is a cryptographic hash algorithm used to generate a 128-bit digest from a string of any length. It represents the digests as 32-digit hexadecimal numbers.

This algorithm was designed by Ronald Rivest in the year 1991 to provide the means for digital signature verification. Eventually, the algorithm got integrated into other frameworks to bolster security indexes.
